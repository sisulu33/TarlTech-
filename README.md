# MaizeGuard AI 🌱🤖

MaizeGuard AI is an agricultural intelligence platform designed to help maize farmers detect crop diseases early using AI-powered image analysis.

## Mission
To empower smallholder farmers in East Africa with accessible, accurate, and early crop disease detection, reducing yield losses and improving food security.

## Problem
Maize farmers in Uganda and across East Africa lose a significant portion of their yield due to late or incorrect disease diagnosis. Access to agronomists and advanced monitoring tools is limited, expensive, or unavailable in rural areas.

## Solution
MaizeGuard AI enables farmers to:
- Upload images of maize leaves using a simple interface
- Receive AI-based disease classification
- View confidence scores and basic recommendations
- Track disease occurrences over time

## Target Users
- **Primary:** Smallholder maize farmers
- **Secondary:** Agronomists, extension workers, NGOs
- **Future:** Large-scale farms and cooperatives

## Roadmap
- **v0 (MVP):** Maize leaf disease detection using images
- **v1:** Disease history and trend analysis
- **v2:** Weather-aware disease risk prediction
- **v3:** Multi-crop support (coffee, cassava)

## Tech Stack (Initial)
- Python, TensorFlow
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- Simple web interface

## Status
🚧 Early development — Week 1 (Vision & Foundation)
